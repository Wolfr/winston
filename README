What is Winston?

You are not building websites anymore. You are building full-fledged web
applications. In order to build the best you can, in order to have room
for innovation, you need a set of defaults so you don’t have to deal with
the monkey jobs anymore – to be able to spend more time solving the real
design issues instead of booting up your Windows machine for the
umptheenth time to solve that cross browser bug.

Winston is a user interface library consisting of common elements in
websites and web applications. These elements work together in an
ecosystem of conventions, guidelines and best practices. The goal of this
library is to provide designers and developers with a solid base to build
user interfaces. Think of it as Rails for designers.
